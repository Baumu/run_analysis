CodeBook – Assignment Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data

Following labels were used to read the different tables:
test_x:     		read table x_test.txt
test_y:			read table y_test.txt
subject_test:		read table subject_test.txt
train_x:			read table x_train.txt
train_y:			read table y_train.txt
subject_train:		read table subject_train.txt
features:		read table features.txt
activity_labels:		read table activity_labels.txt


The following datasets were built:
data_test:		contains the tables test_x, test_y and, subject_test
data_train:		contains the tables train_x, train_y, and subject_train
data:			combines the two sets data_test and data_train
data_short:		contains only those measurements of data that contain mean or std in the 			colnames
data_tidy:		contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The labels to identify were named as follows:
subject_ID:		Identifies the subject by number
activity_ID:		Identifies the activity (such as Walking, Laying etc.)


Descriptive activity names were added:
If activity_ID = 1, the activitiy is “Walking”.
If activity_ID =2, the activity is “Walking Upstairs”.
If activity_ID = 3, the activity is “Walking Downstairs”.
If activity_ID = 4, the activity is “Sitting”.
If activity_ID = 5, the activity is “Standing”.
If activity_ID = 6, the activity is “Laying”.


The different measures are the following:
